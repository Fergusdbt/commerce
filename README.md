#### Description: A web application serving as an e-commerce auction site
#### Command: python manage.py runserver

This is a project submitted as part of Havard University's CS50w online course. 

This web-based application is structured using a Django framework and supported by a SQL database, allowing users to register an account, post new listings, and view other user listings, sorted by category or by 'watchlist' items as requested. Users have the ability to bid for items, comment on listings, and close auctions on their own listings. The database can be accessed and managed using the Django Admin interface by registering a 'super user'.
